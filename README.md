# FTE_Challenge
##by Jorge Martinez

## Setup Steps and Additional Project Information
This challenge was completed using Chrome on MacOS at the moment. I recommend using IntelliJ IDE because I'm using maven 
for the TestNG and selenium famework.

The Chrome driver is already inside the drivers directory by the Project's root directory, Just make sure to have the 
latest version of Chrome as for today (108.0.5359.x). Also I'm using JDK 1.8 so you'll need those in order 
to make the project functional.

##For Feature 1 tests:
Run the designated test inside test/CreatePostsTests.java
##For Feature 2 tests:
Run the designated test inside test/UpdatePostsTests.java
